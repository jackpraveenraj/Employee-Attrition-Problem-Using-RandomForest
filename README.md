TakenMind Project - 
By: Jack Praveen Raj Ilango

## Problem Statement:

1. The data is for Company “X” which is trying to control attrition. 
2. There are two sets of data: “Existing employees” and “Employees who have left”. 
3. What type of employees are leaving? 
4. Determine which employees are prone to leave next.

## Prediction:

1. Adding Column “left_company” so that model could learn and predict who wil leave.
2. Merging both Datasets.
3. Splitting into training and testing datasets. (80% and 20% respectively)
4. Testing accuracies of different models.

### Using Random Forest Classifier -> Accuracy = 98.44% (Highest)

## Suggestions:

1. From the given and the predicted data, we can see that employees with low salaries tend to leave the company. Thus, to prevent that the company may increase their salaries.
2. Similarly, Promoting employees who have not received any promotions in the last 5 years will prevent them from leaving.
3. Employees who have high evaluation scores tend to leave since they have not received a promotion or higher salary.
4. Similarly, Employees who have low evaluation scores tend to either leave or get fired.
